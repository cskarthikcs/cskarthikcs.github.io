<h2>Homework</h2> <br>

All homework must be typeset in Latex. Otherwise the homework will not be evaluated. <br><br>

Each homework has 10 points for presentation. If your homework is very hard to read, these points will be entirely deducted. <br><br>

Homework 1 is due on 09/28. Homework 2 is due on 10/26. Homework 3 is due on 12/14. <br><br>

You are free to discuss about the questions in the homework with other students and even take some help from the TA during recitations, or from AI (at your own risk), but must write the solutions in your own words.<br>

<h2>Grading</h2> <br>

Your grade is computed out of 1000 points. <br><br>

Midterm I is 275 points, Midterm II is assigned 325 points, and the final exam is assigned 400 points.<br><br>

Homework I is 225 points, Homework II is assigned 300 points, and Homework III is assigned 375 points.<br><br>  

A majority of the questions in Midterm I (respectively Midterm II and final exam) will be taken from Homework I (respectively Homework II and Homework III).<br><br>    
  
Your grade will be computed solely based on the points acquired through homework, midterms, and final exam. There are no other extra credits activities for the course. No exceptions.<br><br>

Your total points accumulated is Midterm I + Midterm II + Finals. <br><br>

However, you can replace your Midterm I score (resp.  Midterm II score and Finals score) by your Homework I score (resp. Homework II score and Homework III score) if you obtained more than 150 points (resp. 210 points and 270 points) in Midterm I (resp.  Midterm II and Finals).<br><br>
  
There is no curve: you must earn a minimum of 90% of the total points for an A (900 points), 85% for a B+ (850 points), 80% for a B (800 points), 75% for a C+ (750 points), 70% for a C (700 points),
and 60% for a D (600 points). You will fail the course if you earn less than 60% points (600 points).<br> <br>
The cutoffs are strictly followed for each letter grade. A computed grade of 74.99% is a C not a C+. There are no other extra credits activities for the course. No exceptions.<br><br>

For all the 3 exams the following scaling policy will be applied. If the total points that can be accumulated through a specific exam is X and if the 60 percentile score obtained on the exam is x which is in the interval [1,0.9X],
then everyone’s score will be scaled by a multiplicative factor of (9X)/(10x). For example, if the 60 percentile score obtained on the exam across all students is 100 out of 150 points, then every single student’s score will be multiplied by a factor of 1.35.
Therefore, if you obtained 80 points, then it will be scaled up, and your new score will be 108 points (because 80 × 1.35 = 108). These bonus points are given to counter if the exam is too hard.<br>
