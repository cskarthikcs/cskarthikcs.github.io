<h2> Description of Topics</h2>


<h3 id="kcenter"> Hardness and Approximation of k-center in L_p metrics </h3>
In this meeting we are learning about the complexity of the metric k-center problem with facilities.<br><br>
There is a simple 3 factor approximation polynomial time  algorithm for k-center with facilities<br> and this is tight for general metrics [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_k-center">Wiki</a>].<br><br>
<i> But if the input is from L_p metric space, can we then utilize the geometry of the space<br> to get better polytime approximation algorithms?</i> <br><br>
The answer is NO for L_1 and L_inf metrics and the speaker(s) will present the hardness of<br> approximation results for k-center in L_p metrics that was proved in Section 2 of [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/62212.62255">FG88</a>].<br><br>
On the other hand, the answer is YES for L_2 metric, and the speaker(s) will present the <br>2.74 factor approximation  polytime algorithm given in Section 2 of [<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-36694-9_25">NSS13</a>].


<h3 id="coresets"> Approximate Clustering: Coresets </h3>
Minimizing the Euclidean k-means clustering objective is NP-Hard even when k=2 [<a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/papers/kmeans.pdf">D08</a>]. <br><br>

Suprisingly, for every fixed k, there is a polynomial time approximation scheme (<b>PTAS</b>)<br>
for the Euclidean k-means clustering objective using geometric objects called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coreset">coresets</a>!<br><br>

The speaker(s) will present the construction of these coresets which are described in Section 5.2<br> of [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/070699007">C09</a>] and will also present how to use them to obtain a PTAS for Euclidean k-means problem   <br> for fixed k (Section 6.1 of [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/070699007">C09</a>]).


<h3 id="kmeans++">k-means Clustering: Theory meets Practice</h3>

In practice, clustering tasks are popularly carried out using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_algorithm">Llyod's algorithm</a> with particular<br> emphasis given to its initial seeding (noteworthy is the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1283383.1283494">k-means++</a> seeding). <br><br>


However the success of these algorithms on real-world datasets was not explained by the<br> theoretical analysis
which showed that these algorithms were approximating k-means objective  <br> to â„¦(log k) factor in the worst case.
<br><br>

In <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.1823.pdf">[KK10]</a>, under reasonable assumptions on the input, the authors prove the  success of the<br> above type of algorithms. The speaker(s) will present this result given in Section 5 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.1823.pdf">[KK10]</a>.

<h3 id="TSPgen">Hardness and Approximation of TSP in General metrics</h3>
In this meeting we are learning about the complexity of metric <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">TSP</a>.<br><br>

In 1976, a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christofides_algorithm">3/2 factor approximation polynomial time  algorithm</a> for metric TSP was <br>provided by Christofides. The speaker(s) will present this algorithm and its analysis.<br><br>


On the other hand, it is also known that approximating TSP to a factor better than 123/122<br> is NP-hard and the speaker(s) will present this result of [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022000015000641">KLS15</a>] as well.


 
<h3 id="TSPell2"> Hardness and Approximation of TSP in Euclidean metric </h3>
<i> If the input to TSP is a point-set from the L_p metric space, can we utilize the geometry<br> of the space to obtain a polytime approximation scheme?</i> <br><br>
The answer is NO and the speaker(s) will present the hardness of approximation results<br> for TSP in L_p metrics that was proved in Section 3 of [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S0097539799352735">T00</a>].<br><br>
On the other hand, if the dimension is <b>fixed</b>, then the answer is (surprisingly) YES for the<br>  Euclidean metric  as shown in [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/290179.290180">A98</a>]. The speaker(s) will present a simpler version of this result<br> as given in these <a href="https://theory.epfl.ch/osven/courses/Approx13/Notes/lecture4-5.pdf">lecture notes</a>, for the case when the point-set is from the Euclidean plane.

<h3 id="Brouwermax"> Query Lower Bound of Brouwer Fixed Point in Max Norm</h3>
In this meeting we are learning about the computational aspects of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brouwer_fixed-point_theorem">Brouwer's fixed-point theorem</a><br> in the Max Norm.<br><br>

Given a Brouwer function f: [0,1]<sup>n</sup> â†’ [0,1]<sup>n</sup> that is constant Lipschitz continuous, one may naively<br> find an Îµ-approximate fixed point using 2<sup>O(n/Îµ)</sup> queries in any L_p-metric space by simply querying<br> on a net in [0,1]<sup>n</sup>. <br><br>
In a pioneering work, [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0885064X89900174">HPV89</a>] showed that this simple deterministic query algorithm is essentially<br> optimal for the max norm!<br><br>
Recently, in [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2908734">B16</a>], the author extended this lower bound to randomized queries. The speaker(s) will <br>present this result given in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2908734">B16</a>].

<h3 id="Brouwerell2"> PPAD-hardness of Brouwer Fixed Point in Euclidean Norm </h3>

In a breakthrough work, [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04550">R16</a>] proved a collection of important results, one of which showed <br>
that any randomized query algorithm given as input a Brouwer function f: [0,1]<sup>n</sup> â†’ [0,1]<sup>n</sup> that is <br>constant Lipschitz continuous in the Euclidean space, requires 2<sup>Î©(n/Îµ)</sup> queries to find an<br> Îµ-approximate fixed point.<br><br>

Furthermore, in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04550">R16</a>] is a proof of the PPAD-completeness of an Îµ-approximate fixed point of a<br>    Brouwer function in the Euclidean space. The speaker(s) will present this result given in <br>Section 3 of [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04550">R16</a>].

 <h3 id="Consensus"> PPA-hardness of Consensus Halving </h3>
 A fair way for roommates to divide the monthly rent is intimately connected with the question<br> of determining if (and where) there are two diameterically opposite points on earth with the <br> same temperature and pressure. This is because both these problems are PPA-complete!<br><br>
 
 Recently, in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.04503.pdf">FG18</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12559.pdf">FG19</a>], the authors proved that a host of important problems related to<br> fair division are all PPA-complete.<br><br>
 
 The speaker(s) will present the PPA-completeness result for the celebrated Consensus Halving<br> problem [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_division">Wiki</a>], whose simplified proof is  given in Section 3 of [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11437.pdf">FHSZ20</a>].

 
 <h3 id="Lowdegreetest"> Low Degree Polynomial Tests </h3>
 Low Degree Testing, the problem of testing the proximity of a function to a family of low-degree<br> polynomials has been intensively studied in the context of property testing and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistically_checkable_proof">PCPs</a> over the<br> last thirty years. <br><br>
 
 The analysis of these tests highlight the interplay between  algebra and geometry (over finite fields). <br>The speaker(s) will present a simple low-degree along with its non-trivial analysis detailed in <br>these <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/PDF/pt-low.pdf">lecture notes</a>.

 
 <h3 id="LSH">  Approximation of Closest Pair: Locality Sensitive Hash </h3>
The closest pair problem [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closest_pair_of_points_problem">Wiki</a>] in constant dimensions was among the first geometric problems<br>  that were treated at the origins of the systematic study of the computational complexity of<br> geometric algorithms.<br><br>

However, it is known that closest pair problem in high dimensions cannot be solved in subquadratic<br> time. In this light, the powerful Locality Sensitive Hashing technique was developed
[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing">Wiki</a>] in <br>[<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/276698.276876">IM98</a>] to approximately   solve the problem in subquadratic time.<br><br>

The speaker(s) will present a taste of this technique given in these <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse521/17wi/521-lecture-6.pdf">lecture notes</a>.
Then, the <br>speaker(s) will present the near optimal LSH constructions given in [<a href="http://web.mit.edu/andoni/www/papers/cSquared.pdf">AI06</a>].


 <h3 id="polymethod"> Approximation of Bichromatic Closest Pair: Polynomial Method </h3>
Despite LSH providing highly effective approximate solutions to the closest pair problem, <br>the extent of it's approximation guarantees (in the worst case) were shown in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0250">OWZ09</a>]<br><br>

At the same time, works in the flourishing area of fine-grained complexity (such as [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6680">W14</a>]),<br> provided insights to use the polynomial method in algorithm design.<br><br>

In a series of papers listed <a href="https://tmc.web.engr.illinois.edu/pub_poly.html">here</a>, the authors provide the state-of-the-art approximation<br> algorithms for the closest pair problem. The speaker(s) will present one or more of these papers.

<h3 id="DistPCP">  Hardness of Bichromatic Closest Pair </h3>

In a breakthrough work, [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06407">ARW17</a>] proved the first hardness of approximation results in <br>fine-grained complexity. Their work provided a foundational framework to rule out<br> subquadratic time approximation algorithms for a host of important geometric and<br> string problems. <br><br>
In particular, in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00904">R18</a>], the author rules out subquadratic algorithms for the bichromatic<br> closest pair problem which approximate to a factor 1+Îµ for some tiny Îµ&gt;0.<br><br>
The speaker(s) will first present Sections 3, 4, and 5 of [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06407">ARW17</a>] and then the above result<br> given in Sections 3 and 4 of [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00904">R18</a>].

<h3 id="CVP"> Exponential Time Approximation of Closest Vector Problem </h3>
The closest vector problem is a foundational problem in lattice based cryptography [<a href="https://cryptography.fandom.com/wiki/Lattice_problem">Wiki</a>].<br><br>

While the problem is NP-Hard even to approximate to any constant factor, it has motivated<br> the study of exponential time approximation algorithms.<br><br>

The speaker(s) will present one such result given in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.2289.pdf">EHN11</a>].
